# Fairy Lights
An Arduino library to control various fairy lights. So far, we support the 2-wire M1359L bulbs (sold on a strip with a third "bypass" wire) and a 3-wire bulb strips (also with an extra wire) that can display 2 different colors at once.

Some examples that we've attempted to support:
* [66 Feet 200 LED](https://smile.amazon.com/Waterproof-Changing-Lighting-Christmas-Decoration/dp/B08GX7WP84/)
* [33 Feet 100 LED](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07STZQ744/)

## Disclaimer

I am very new to low voltage projects and the arduino... this library and the interface to it may not be stable for awhile, if ever.

One of the first Arduino projects I worked on was trying to get [these fairy lights](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B086LC36Q3/) working. [Brent Yardley](https://github.com/yardleyb) was helping me with learning the electronics and we quickly realized that there was no useful spec or library for working with this LED strip.

After experimenting quite a bit, this is the result so far...
