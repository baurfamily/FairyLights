# M1359
An Arduino library to control M1359 fairy lights

## Disclaimer

I have no idea what I'm doing... this library and the interface to it may not be stable for awhile, if ever.

One of the first Arduino projects I worked on was trying to get [these fairy lights](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B086LC36Q3/) working. [Brent Yardley](https://github.com/yardleyb) was helping me with learning the electronics and we quickly realized that there was no useful spec or library for working with this LED strip.

After experimenting quite a bit, this is the result so far... no promises!
