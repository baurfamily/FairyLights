 # Capabilities and Support

I don't know the best way to keep track of these things... I *thought* I ordered the same one off Amazon twice, but got two different products... even so, I listed the ASIN.

|SKU/ASIN|Brand|Wires|Independent|Length|LED Count|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|X002MU7YEH / B08GX7WP84|GIMGOM|3|Yes (count?)|66 ft (33x2)|200 (100x2)|
|X002IFWDHT / B086LC36Q3|Minetom|4 + bypass|No|66 ft (33x2)|200 (100x2)|
|X002M8PT23|Minetom|3 + bypass|Yes (2 colors)|33 ft|100|
|B086LC36Q3|Minetom|2 + bypass|No*|66 ft|200|

## Notes

Anywhere a "bypass" wire is mentioned, it means a wire that runs the lenth of the strip and is connected at the far end to one of the other wires without being connected to any LEDs along it's own path. Generally this seems to be a ground wire, but not always.

### Minetom 2 wire w/bypass

This strip does not have a "controllable" way to set different LEDs to different colors, however we have found that we can touch the bypass wire quickly to the VCC wire and it will set the lights somewhat randomly. After this, you can fade or go to the "next" color and they will stay consistently out of sync. We're still looking for a way to do this programatically, but havent found a way yet.

See [this readme](Minetom_2wire.md) for more details on how this strip works.
